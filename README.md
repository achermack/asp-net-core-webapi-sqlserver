# ASP.NET Core WebAPI with SQL Server Boilerplate
## Built using Docker-Compose

Note: Requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

Based off of [this](https://docs.docker.com/compose/aspnet-mssql-compose/) with some exceptions, notably;
 - .NET Core 5.0
 - Base Application is WebAPI instead of an MVC style
 - ApplicationDbContext configured to use containerized SqlServer instance
